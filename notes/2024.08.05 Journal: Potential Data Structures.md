For context, an [item](<http://t>) is a character. A [sequence](<http://t>) is a set of characters in a specific order. Sequential items in a sequence are *logically contiguous*. A sequence data structure will keep the items of the sequence in a [buffer](<http://t>)—a set of sequentially addressed memory locations (contiguous memory)—but not necessarily in the same order they appear in the sequence. When a (portion of or entire) sequence is physically contiguous in a buffer and logically contiguous in the sequence, it is known as a [span](<http://t>). A [descriptor](<http://t>) is a pointer to a span. "Sequence data structures keep spans in buffers and keep enough information (in terms of descriptors and sequences of descriptors) to piece together the spans to form the sequence." ¹

[_Gap Buffer (two spans, one buffer)_](<https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds/node9.html>)  
This method uses a single, large buffer to hold all the text of a file. Within this buffer, the text is organized with a gap in the middle (for efficient insertions/deletions). The valid text is then split between two spans—one before the gap and one after the gap—in a manner that is logically contiguous, a later word follows an earlier word in memory, but not physically contiguous (because of the gap). A descriptor, which keeps track of where a span starts and ends within the buffer (chunk of memory), is assigned to each span and the gap.
```mathematica
Buffer: [hello-------world]
         span1  gap  span2
```
[_Piece Table_ (two buffers, many spans](<https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds/node15.html>)  
This method operates on two buffers: a fixed-size, read-only buffer containing the entire text of the file and a resizable, append-only buffer which stores additions. Separately, modifications are tracked by a [piece table](<http://t>), which dynamically splits spans based on edits to the sequence; before any edits, the original buffer is represented as a single span in the piece table. Each span, an edit, is known as a [piece](<http://t>) (of the sequence) and its descriptor is called a [piece descriptor](<http://t>). Each "...[piece] descriptor must contain three pieces of information: which buffer (a boolean), an offset into that buffer (a non-negative integer) and a length (a positive integer)." ² Remember, the original buffer is __never__ modified; instead, deletions/modifications are merely reflected in the piece table, which is read by the program to display the proper text. Therefore, the original file is typically only modified on save. __NOTE__: although the piece table is visualized vertically, it is effectivley an array of structs read left-to-right.
```mathematica
Original Buffer: [Hello, world!]
Additions Buffer: [amazing ]
Piece Table:
| Buffer Indicator | Offset | Length |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| Original         | 0      | 6      |  // "Hello,"
| Additions        | 0      | 8      |  // "amazing "
| Original         | 7      | 6      |  // "world!"
Final Text: "Hello, amazing world!"
```
Inversely,
```mathematica
Original Buffer: [Hello, amazing world!]
Additions Buffer: []
Piece Table:
| Buffer Indicator | Offset | Length |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| Original         | 0      | 7      |  // "Hello, "
| Original         | 15     | 6      |  // "world!"
Final Text: "Hello, world!"
```
[_Rope String (a balanced tree)_](<http://t>)  
This method uses an [ordered tree](http://t>) to represent strings: each internal node represents the concatenation of its children and leaves consist of *flat strings* (contiguous arrays of characters). "Thus the string represented by a tree is the concatenation of its leaves in left-to-right order..." ³ This "tree" structure, which is more-closely a [directed acyclic graph](<http://t>), is called a rope. Ropes can be seen as search trees, indexed by position, where each vertex contains the length of the string represented by the subtree. __NOTE__: in this structure, all strings are immutable; hence, any node modifications require copying. **This paper is so technical my brain still isn't computing. Will re-attempt tomorrow.**
```mathematica
                          [Concatenation]
                              /       \
                     [Concatenation]   [Leaf: "fox"]
                        /       \
           [Node: "The qui"]  [Node: "ck brown"]
              /      \           /      \
           null    null       null    null
```
